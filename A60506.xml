            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Theſe Contentions were not only amongſt the Common ſort, but alſo among their Miniſters; for when they had been forth in ſome certain Country, where they had raiſed a People to themſelves, then ſome other of them came that way; and peradventure, he was in more Favour than the firſt which had taken all the payns, and many times ſuffered long Impriſonment in thoſe Parts; then when thoſe which came after, were the moſt in reſpect amongſt them; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeing this, that the other got the Fruit of his Labour, he was much diſ-ſatisfied, that the other ſhould after this ſort have his <hi>Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick</hi> taken from him, and another to enjoy the Fruit of the ſame: and as it were, to carry the Fame of it to himſelf: theſe many times would fall to Words; but ſometimes it fell out, that the firſt, through Diſſatisfaction, returned home, and went to Viſit his People no more.</p>

               <p>There were ſome alſo which were diſſatisfied about ſome things which the other did hold, whereupon, there grew ſuch Diſſentions amongſt them, that the one party would acknowledge the other nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be of God, nor of the Truth; with ſome of theſe <hi>George Fox</hi> did encounter himſelf, but that would not overturn them, but ſtill remained in their obſtinacy; whereupon, there was, as it were, open War betwixt them, indeavouring to over throw each other; but <hi>George Fox</hi> got the greater Party on his ſide, and then did he with all his might endeavour to over throw the other; and if any of the other went to preach, or ſpeak, in any Place or Meeting, he ſent others of his Miniſters to procl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But when he could not hold his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, then he began to father all this his Errours upon his Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At another time, I ſpake of Spirits, and ſaid, that there were Spiritual bodies and Angels; but he denied all; and ſaid, that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e was Light and Darkneſs; and the one was of God, and the other of the Devil; (meaning rather, that the one was God, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devil,) and that there was no diſtinct Spirits nor Angels, for he could never ſee them in the Divine Light. And further, did affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m, that if there were any, he ſhould have ſeen them; but he never ſaw any, therefore there was none. This and the like words he ſpoke and held forth to me, to have me to believe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an Atheiſt or Ranter; for they both hold the ſame, and it is their Principle; and whoſoever holdeth the ſame, is of the like Principle. This was ſpoken in <hi>Margaret Fell</hi>'s room in the aforeſaid Caſtle.</p>
               <p>Then I Diſcourſed with him about the Soul; and I affirmed, that it had a Spiritual body after this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After this, <hi>Jo. Stubs</hi> and I being together in my Chamber, we did Diſcourſe about the Soul of man after this Life; He ſaid that he did believe that there was no Puniſhment after this Life, and that which was in this Life was for Diſobedience to the Light; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he ſaid, <hi>That as all dyed in Adam, ſo in the ſecond Adam</hi> (that is Chriſt) <hi>all were made alive, and that all ſhould go one and the ſame way when they were dead, and that they ſhould not have any Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſin hereafter; but what was, it was in this Life; and that the Soul ſhould go to God that gave it.</hi> And further, he ſaid, It was not his Principle alone, for <hi>Geo. Fox</hi> did hold the ſame; and <hi>Geo.</hi> ſaid, <hi>That thoſe that did believe any other ways, were of the Old Opinion.</hi> But this muſt be kept ſecret, leſt it ſhould caſt a Stumbling-block before the Weak; but as they came to grow up in the Truth, they would come to ſee it in the Light.</p>
               <p>But I was altogether againſt him, and brought this Scripture of the Apoſtles againſt them; which ſaid, <hi>If we have Hope but in this Life only, we are of all men moſt miſerable.</hi> But let me ſay what I could, I could not perſwade him from it, becauſe <hi>Geo.

                  </gap>er this, I diſcourſed with <hi>George Fox</hi> about the Beaſts of the Field, and creeping things; he did affirm, that they had Reaſon as well as Man, and that all the differences betwixt man and them, was only, that man was fallen from his firſt eſtate, and that the beaſt were not; that man was worſe than the beaſt. I asked him, what difference there was betwixt the Soul of a man, and of a beaſt? he ſaid, <hi>That God breathed into man the breath of Life, and ſo he did into all Creatures; and that all the Vertue in all things were of the Light; and when they were at an end, they did return to God again.</hi> For he looked upon God, not as being a Spirit, but a great Light, as the Light of the Day; and the Night, as the Devil; and that theſe are two great beings of themſelves, and are without any cauſe as the day hath; for the Sun is the cauſe of the Light, and it's abſence the cauſe of the Night. But this he did not underſtand: I wiſh he may underſtand that there is a God, which is the firſt moving Cauſe of that Divine Light; and alſo, that there are Angels, or Devils; all which, he and others that believe not the ſame, may
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35553:10" rendition="simple:additions"/> come to know the Truth of it too ſoon, for if there were nothing elſe but what he believeth, then what need men learn any thing? and certainly if this be true as he ſaith, then it muſt needs be true, that that is a new Light which he hath, for it is not like that which the Prophets and Apoſtle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> had, for they believe that there were Angels which are Spirits, and alſo Devils that are Spirits: But how any ſuch an one can truly know God, and teach his <hi>Truth,</hi> and all the <hi>Truths</hi> which belong to that great Divine <hi>Power, I</hi> know not, but leave it for others to Judge.</p>
               <p>After this, when I underſtood that this was taking Root amongſt ſome of the Chief of them, I was reſolved, that where-ever I found them holding theſe Tenents, or the like to it, I would uſe my beſt endeavour to over-turn, if poſſible I could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſt in time it might grow, and ſo bring them into <hi>Arantiſm;</hi> this I reſolved in my ſelf, and in part put it forward; for meeting with ſome that were already Infected with it, by ſuch Arguments as I brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, were ſomething convinced that there was Spirits, and that Man ſhould have a beeing after this Life.</p>
               <p>Then theſe things put me to a ſtand, whether I ſhould come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them or not, ſeeing they we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Yet for all this, I was reſolved to keep this rapt up in the cloſe Garment of Secrecy, and not to declare it to others, leſt at laſt it ſhould come forth to the Eares of all Men, and ſo turn a reproach to me, I being one of them; but ſtill this falſe deluding Fancy did more and more work in them, by reaſon that they had fallen from the <hi>Truth,</hi> into theſe Errours, as aforeſaid, and as you ſhall ſee further.</p>

               <p>If they refuſe to confeſs, and repent, then they ſummon them in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Court, there to anſwer; which if they do not, they go to them the third time; if they ſtand out then, they paſs Sentence on them, That they are not to come amongſt them: But to me they did not grant this priviledge, but caſt me forth at the firſt time, without letting me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.

               <p>After they have been once caſt out, and then be found in any fault, then they are to be called as at the firſt, to their Confeſſion and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but if they ſtand it out, then they are to be caſt out from the Society of all Men, as they did me, as you ſhall underſtand by what is hereafter written, (I ſuppoſe, if they had power, and that the Law of the Nation would not take hold of them, as aforeſaid) then they would baniſh them into ſome Wilderneſs, where no Man Inhabits; but however, it muſt ſtand in the ſence of the ſame, for no man muſt have any Commerce with ſuch a one, as is thus excommunicated, as he tendereth his own good, and the favour of the Church; but there is mercy for him, for if he will ſend his ſubmiſſion to them, ſigned with

               <p>But here we may underſtanding, that they are not like unto God, for he will forgive ſeventy times ſeven; but there is the end of their Law, and their Charity cannot extend it ſelf any further.

               <p>G. F. <hi>But there is another thing thou didſt at his Houſe, thou waſt uncivil there, and offeredſt ſome abuſe to his Kinſwoman, or Siſter.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I know not his Kinſwoman, or Siſter, any more than him whom I never ſaw in my life; nor I know not that I did any thing to them that was uncivil, that I remember; and if I did ſalute one, or both of them, it is more than I can remember; but it may be I did, and that was all.

               <p>G. F. <hi>That's well ſaid, thou doſt well to confeſs the Truth, and to be ſorry for it: but what doſt thou ſay to the other, concerning the Stones?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>H.

                  <hi>H. B.</hi> There was ſome idle Diſcourſe ſtir'd up by his vain mind, which made me ſpeak ſome vain words; but what he ſaith, is falſe, and he lies.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But yet for all his well-doing, and ſaying, and for this commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>George</hi>'s, he did but praiſe a lyar; for he ſpoke not the truth in any thing, as it was done at the firſt.</p>
               <p>Then I ſaid to him, that he had not ſpoken the Truth, but did lye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>H. B.</hi> If they were the laſt word that I ſhould ſpeak, they are true; but he ſpoke after that, therefore he did lie.</p>
               <p>I anſwered, if there be any Truth in Heaven above, or in the Earth beneath, that which he hath ſpoken, is falſe; then they blam'd

                  <hi>Anſw. I</hi> remember that the laſt time I was here, he ſerved me after this manner, which I condeſcended to, and then he would not let me ſpeak any further; but that I muſt repent of that, or elſe I muſt not come among them; therefore I will not.</p>

               <p>G. F. <hi>We muſt not ſpend our Precious time thus, for we have other things to do, and to wait upon the Lord; and if thou will</hi> not Submit, <hi>then thou muſt go from amongſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi>

               <p>Then G. <hi>Fox</hi> Commanded me to go from amongſt them, for they had other things to do: but that good Saint, <hi>Hilkiah Bedford,</hi> was received again, and ſuffered to be as one of them; but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted at his Command.</p>
               <p>Some few dayes after this, I came to ſome of their Houſes, and they took occaſion to ſpeak to me of the laſt Tryal, and ſaid, that I muſt bear with Friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> told them, that I had born with them theſe 10 Years, in hopes, that in time they would grow in the Truth, and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and then they would caſt off all ſuch Ceremonies, and Conceits, as they had got amongſt them, as you ſhall here fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
